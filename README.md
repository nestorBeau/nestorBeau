## 👤 About Me

> *"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing."*  
> — Dwight K. Schrute, The Office

I specialize in the human component of IT security – Social Engineering, Phishing Analysis, and Security Awareness. My focus is on identifying and understanding vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

**How would I describe myself in three words?**
- **Layer-8-specialist** – Humans are often the weakest link
- **Merciless** – Relentless in the pursuit of vulnerabilities
- **Insatiable** – Insatiable thirst for knowledge

*Yes, that's a The Office reference. No, I'm not quite as... intense as Dwight.*

## Academic Work & Research

### Research Paper: Phishing & Social Engineering

I authored an academic paper on **Phishing and Social Engineering** based on **real-world data** from actual attack scenarios. The research analyzes:

- Psychological manipulation techniques in phishing campaigns
- Success rates of various social engineering vectors
- Prevention strategies and security awareness training
- Empirical analysis of user behavior under simulated attacks

This research forms the foundation of my practical understanding of the "Layer 8" problem in cyber security.
